			<h2>The basic Korean Food</h2><!---the title of pragraph --->
			<p>Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.
			Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Korean diet. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage. </p><!---the content --->

			<h2>10 essential korean table manners</h2><!---the title of pragraph --->
			<p>Rule #1: Say ‘Jal-mukkes-seub-nida’, which means ‘I will eat well’, or ‘I will enjoy this meal’.<br>
			Rule #2: Respect for elders is a core value in Korean culture that is also practised at the dining table.<br>
			Rule #3: Begin your meal with a taste of soup or stews. This warms your tongue and preps your taste-buds.<br>
			Rule #4: Chopsticks are for dishes, a spoon is for rice and soup. Don’t hold your chopsticks and spoon at once.<br>
			Rule #5: Sharing is caring, cliché as that may be, but absolutely true in a Korean meal.<br>
			Rule #6: Korean meals have many tastes and flavours from the combination of soup, rice, meat and veggie dishes.<br>
			Rule #7: Don’t wolf down your food, or chomp with your mouth open.<br>
			Rule #8: Enjoying your food and company is more important than scrolling your phone. <br>
			Rule #9: When passing bowls, glasses, or dishes, always use both hands to show respect.<br>
			Rule #10: Finish by placing your chopsticks and spoon beside your bowl or plate, not atop.
